## Overview

This version of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played by two different players on different devices. Neither player can see the other's selection until the round is complete. Each player's stats persist between sessions and there is a custom built chat feature that players can use during the game.

## Game Start

Players begin by entering their name. If player is returning their Win/Loss record will be displayed beneath their name after they have logged in. Once both players have logged in, game chat becomes available at the bottom of the screen.

## Gameplay

Player One makes their selection while Player Two waits their turn. Neither player is able to see the selections of the other. Once both playeres have made their selection, the result will be shown, stats will update, and an option to start a new game appears. Starting a new game requires both players to enter their names again.

## Known Issues

- Mobile styles are a work in progress.
- Refreshing the page in the middle of a game can prevent player progress. For the best experience, please do not refresh the page.
- Occasionally, the page can be slow to render or update. Patience is a virtue.
